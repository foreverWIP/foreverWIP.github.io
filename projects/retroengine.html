      <h1>Retro Engine Hacking</h1>
      <p>The technical aspects of the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Genesis/Mega Drive were a major influence in me learning to code. It's only natural then that I've toyed around lots with <a href="https://eveningstar.studio/tech.html">Retro Engine</a>, the custom-built engine used to officially ship remakes of the games (as well as retro revival Sonic Mania) between 2011-2022. While I have made my own private efforts to reverse engineer version 5 (the version of the engine that Mania uses), it was quickly superseded by <a href="https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation">a separate large-scale decompilation effort</a>. Regardless, the engine is a very fun base for me to explore different design challenges. Here are a few projects I've started with my skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/foreverWIP/RSDKv5-Decompilation/tree/rust-integration">Rust integration (ongoing)</a>: This fork is attempting to port v5 of the decompilation to Rust, as a means to explore the tradeoffs of rust at FFI boundaries and as a way to make certain parts of the codebase easier to refactor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/foreverWIP/cosmic">Cosmic (proof of concept)</a>: This is a complete source port of v3 (the version of the engine used by the Sonic CD remake) to C#. It also contains many major changes, such as a full-featured 2D hardware rendering backend, real-time settings configuration, collision viewer, and more. Not finished due to third-party library usage getting complicated, and my growing distaste of C# at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had additionally gotten v5 ported to C# at one point, and had even started porting over objects from Mania, but stopped when I realized the sheer scale of tackling the game side... I no longer have the repo, but I do have videos backed up to show what progress had been made.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Wii ports: I also had v4 and v5 ported to the Wii at one point. Unfortunately I no longer have the code for these ports either, however my work on the Wii port of v5 did attract the attention of someone else working on <a href="https://github.com/Mefiresu/RSDKv5-Decompilation">their own port</a>, and I've since provided some advice and assistance with them understanding the codebase and Wii toolchain.</li>
