      <h1>Sonic 1 C Port</h1>
      <p>Source <a href="https://github.com/foreverWIP/s1-port">here</a>.</p>
<p><video src="../assets/video/s1portwip.mp4" controls="controls"></video></p>
<p>This is a work-in-progress full port of Sonic the Hedgehog (revision 1) for the Mega Drive to C, designed and built over the course of roughly 19 months as of April 2025.</p>
<p>The intent of this project is to provide a base from which the game and its mechanics can be experienced and ported to a variety of platforms, without any compromise to how the gameplay handed in the original. The version of Sonic 1 currently promoted by Sega is not a port but a remake of the original, made with a completely different game engine (in fact, it's the same Retro Engine that I've hacked on in my other hobby projects, go figure). Unlike that version, this project is built off of the original Mega Drive game's machine code, with as few changes made as possible.</p>
<p>I accomplished this by writing a program (<code>asmconverter</code> in the source) that generates &quot;nearly-correct&quot; C code from all the code it can find in the original ROM, assisted by a symbol map from <a href="https://github.com/sonicretro/s1disasm">an existing disassembly</a> and a few heuristics. Then, I go through all the generated code and manually fix any issues from the generator that would be too complex to fix automatically (dynamic jumps, complex control flow, code that wasn't picked up by the converter). I compile the resulting C (<code>sonic1c</code> in the source) with TCC (though other compilers will probably work) into a library, and load it through a separate program written in Rust (<code>sonic1</code> in the source).</p>
<p>The program acts as a specialized &quot;frontend&quot; for Speedshoes (<code>speedshoes</code> in the source), a Mega Drive emulation framework I wrote for this project. Speedshoes contains a minimal implementation of the Mega Drive hardware bus and Video Display Processor (VDP). It is capable of running the original ROM, albeit with some slight runtime patching to accomodate for extra features. Notably, it can detect whenever 68k subroutines are called, and is able to intercept or &quot;hook&quot; those calls with calls into C &quot;scripts&quot;. For the sake of accuracy with the game, the C scripts all share a separate RAM area and set of registers from the emulator, and after every hook, the state of the C side is compared with the emulator. Additionally, Speedshoes supports checking accuracy at the level of individual instructions, allowing one to recreate a perfect reimplementation of a Mega Drive game down to the CPU register, without interpreting a single byte of code in ROM.</p>
<p>All game code has been successfully converted (barring some inaccuracies my testing might not have picked up), so now all current work is centered on cleaning up the generated code, further decoupling the drawing code from the VDP, and adding additional features. In the video above, I demonstrate the addition of widescreen support.</p>
