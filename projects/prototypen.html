      <h1>Prototype N</h1>
      <p>In the beginning of August 2021, I was in contact with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/qqnosh">Arrietty</a>, who was preparing a demo of her personal game for <a href="https://sagexpo.org/#/about">SAGE</a>, a fangame and indie game expo. She was in need of some audio to use for the game, so I volunteered to help.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/img/pnscreenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of Prototype N gameplay, namely in the Abandoned Mines level." title="Retro-style platforming and shooting action!" /></p>
<p>Most of my work went toward making music for Abandoned Mines, a level that takes you deep
underground into a cave filled with all manner of traps. My initial drafts were much slower in pace and leaned more on the &quot;chunky&quot; sound of certain FM patches.</p>

<p>As I got more visuals and footage to go by the song started to take a more energetic form.</p>
<p><audio controls><source src="../assets/sound/stage04mid.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></p>
<p>Still, many elements of the arrangement stayed through its development, such as prominent usage of FM synthesis, and square wave flourishes. Nine days later, I finished the song:</p>

<p>I also worked on some sound effects specific to the level, for example the sounds made by the spike crushers and grappling rails. It was a terrific chance to flex my skills with sound design and usage of samples. For example, to get the sort of cartoony, semi-realistic grumble of a large boulder, I took an old, low-fidelity sample of a rifle being fired, EQ'd the high frequencies to be more prominent, then pitched the sample down as it played.</p>
