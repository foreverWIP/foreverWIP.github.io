In the beginning of August 2021, I was in contact with my friend [Arrietty](https://twitter.com/qqnosh), who was preparing a demo of her personal game for [SAGE](https://sagexpo.org/#/about), a fangame and indie game expo. She was in need of some audio to use for the game, so I volunteered to help.

Most of my work went toward making music for Abandoned Mines, a level that takes you deep
underground into a cave filled with all manner of traps. My initial drafts [were much slower](stage04early.mp3) and sounded more like Spelunky, but as I got more visuals and footage to go by the song started to [take a more energetic form](stage04mid.mp3). Still, many elements of the arrangement stayed through its development, such as prominent usage of FM synthesis, and square wave flourishes. Nine days later, [I finished the song](stage04final.ogg).

I also worked on some sound effects specific to the level, for example the sounds made by the [spike crushers](pn_crushersfx.ogg) and grappling rails. It was a terrific chance to flex my skills with sound design and usage of samples. For example, to get the sort of cartoony, semi-realistic grumble of [a large boulder](pn_bouldersfx.ogg), I took an old, low-fidelity sample of a rifle being fired, EQ'd the high frequencies to be more prominent, then pitched the sample down as it played.
