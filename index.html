<p>Welcome! I’m Amy Farbright, a transgender programmer and creative. Some quick info:</p>

<p>The first computer I ever touched was a video game console. Even at an early age I held a deep fascination with computers, and their ability to entertain. At around age 12 or 13, I remember reading an article in a games magazine about programming, and it kickstarted my interest in <em>making</em> games as much as playing them. I started learning C#, as that's what was promoted through XNA at the time. Around the same time I also started getting into retro game disassembly and hacking, and I started learning Motorola 68000 assembly. It snowballed from there; As the years went by I picked up on various other programming languages (Lua, Python, C), and when I was bored of programming I'd also learn some multimedia software (Photoshop, FL Studio, After Effects). Up until a few years ago, most of what I worked on was private, personal projects that never really got anywhere. But now that I've dipped my toe in public-facing projects, I've decided that I want to show off and document what I work on more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Notable programming languages I've used in any capacity:</p>
<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>M68k Assembly</li>
<li>GDScript</li>
<li>HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, some Liquid (enough to make this website anyway :P)</li>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Java</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable game engines I've used in any capacity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Godot</li>
<li>Unity</li>
<li>LÖVE2D</li>
</ul>
<p>(I also have experience working on other proprietary engines themselves.)</p>
<p>Notable software I've used in any capacity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photoshop</li>
<li>FL Studio</li>
<li>After Effects</li>
<li>Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>Audacity</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Make</li>
<li>GCC, GDB et. al.</li>
<li>Basically the standard Linux/UNIX development suite</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope what I have to show now and in the future sparks interest or inspiration to anyone that sees. &lt;3</p>
