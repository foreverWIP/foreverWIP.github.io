## My history with computing and media creation

The first computer I ever touched was a video game console. Even at an early age I held a deep fascination with computers, and their ability to entertain. At around age 12 or 13, I remember reading an article in a games magazine about game programming, and it kickstarted my interest in *making* games as much as playing them. I started learning C#, as that's what was the most approachable having grown up using a Windows PC. Around the same time I also started getting into retro game disassembly and hacking, and I started learning Motorola 68000 assembly. It snowballed from there; As the years went by I picked up on various other programming languages (Lua, Python, C), and when I was bored of programming I'd also learn some multimedia software (Photoshop, FL Studio, After Effects). Up until a few years ago, most of what I worked on was private, personal projects that never really got anywhere. But now that I've dipped my toe in public-facing projects, I've decided that I want to show off and document what I work on more thoroughly.

Notable programming languages I've used in any capacity:
- C#
- M68k Assembly
- Lua
- Python
- GDScript
- Java
- C
- C++
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some Ruby (enough to make this website anyway :P)
- GML

Notable game engines I've used in any capacity:
- Godot
- Unity
- LÖVE2D
- Game Maker Studio

(I also have experience working on other proprietary engines themselves.)

Notable software I've used in any capacity:
- Photoshop
- FL Studio
- After Effects
- Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code
- Audacity
- Git
- Bash
- Make
- GCC, GDB et. al.
- Basically the standard Linux/UNIX development suite
- Jekyll

I hope what I have to show now and in the future sparks interest or inspiration to anyone that sees. <3
