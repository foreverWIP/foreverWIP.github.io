# RSDKv4 Wii

This is an ongoing project of mine, involving [porting a decompilation of the mobile remakes of Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2 to the Nintendo Wii](https://github.com/foreverWIP/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation/tree/passion).

Work is still ongoing, and while the games are currently fully playable, there is still work to be done in order to take better advantage of the Wii's hardware before prebuilt binaries and build instructions go public.
