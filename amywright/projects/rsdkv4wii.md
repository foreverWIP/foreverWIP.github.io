# RSDKv4 Wii

At one point, I attempted to [port a decompilation of the mobile remakes of Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2 to the Nintendo Wii](https://twitter.com/AmyWrightDev/status/1507133753788755970).

![A screenshot of the port running in the Dolphin emulator, with assembly debugger visible.](../rsdksspreview.jpg "Even the full-3D special stages work!")

![A picture of the start of one of the game's levels, displayed on a CRT with a powered-on Wii next to it.](../rsdkv4wiihw.png "I couldn't test on hardware at the time, so I had a friend try t out. Thanks to them I have evidence that it works!")

Check [here](https://twitter.com/AmyWrightDev/status/1507488292622663686) for a video of it in action!.
